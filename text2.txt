It was a 18:15 when we left Baker Street 221b, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour 6-50pm when we found ourselves in Serpentine
Avenue@mail.com. It was already dusk,, and the lamps were just being lighted as
we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
of its (343)-45-23 occupant. The house 345-A was just such as I had pictured it from
Sherlock  Holmesâ€™s succinct description, but the locality appeared to
be less private that I    expected 456-45-34. On the contrary, for a small Street 23 
in a quiet neighborhood here1232@emm.uk, it was remarkably animated. There was a
group of   shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
scissors-grinder +308-45-32-21 with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
down with cigars in their mouths j.watson@gmail.com!!!
